#How to write Chaincode

##What is covered?
We will be building up to a working chaincode that will be able to create generic assets. 
Then we will show how to interact with the chaincode via the networks API.

##What is chaincode?
Chaincode is a piece of code that lets you interact with a network's shared ledger.  Whenever you 'invoke' a transaction on the network, you are effectively calling a function in a piece of chaincode that read and writes values to the ledger.

#Implementing Your First Chaincode

###Environment Setup
- Download and install GoLang for your OS - https://golang.org/dl/
- Add the Hyperledger shim code to your Go path by opening a command prompt/terminal and type:
	
	```
	go get GitHub.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim
	```

##GitHub Setup
The Bluemix IBM Blockchain service currently requires chaincode to be in a [GitHub](https://Github.com/) repository.
Therefore, you should register a GitHub account and setup Git locally on your computer.
- Create a new repo for this project named `my_first_chaincode`
- Clone the repo to your local machine

###Starting Code
Copy and save the starting template code below to a new file: `my_first_chaincode/chaincode.go`

**Template Code**
```
package main

import (
	"errors"
	"fmt"

	"GitHub.com/Hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim"
)

// SimpleChaincode example simple Chaincode implementation
type SimpleChaincode struct {
}

// Main
func main() {
	err := shim.Start(new(SimpleChaincode))
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Error starting Simple chaincode: %s", err)
	}
}

// Init - reset all the things
func (t *SimpleChaincode) Init(stub *shim.ChaincodeStub, function string, args []string) ([]byte, error) {
	if len(args) != 1 {
		return nil, errors.New("Incorrect number of arguments. Expecting 1")
	}

	return nil, nil
}

// Invoke - Our entry point
func (t *SimpleChaincode) Invoke(stub *shim.ChaincodeStub, function string, args []string) ([]byte, error) {
	fmt.Println("invoke is running " + function)

	// Handle different functions
	if function == "init" {													//initialize the chaincode state, used as reset
		return t.Init(stub, "init", args)
	} else if function == "dummy_invoke" {									//deletes an entity from its state
		return t.dummy_invoke(stub, args)
	}
	fmt.Println("invoke did not find func: " + function)					//error

	return nil, errors.New("Received unknown function invocation")
}

// Query - Our entry point for Queries
func (t *SimpleChaincode) Query(stub *shim.ChaincodeStub, function string, args []string) ([]byte, error) {
	fmt.Println("query is running " + function)

	// Handle different functions
	if function == "dummy_query" {											//read a variable
		return t.dummy_query(stub, args)
	}
	fmt.Println("query did not find func: " + function)						//error

	return nil, errors.New("Received unknown function query")
}

```

###Dependencies
The `import` statement list a few dependencies that you will need for your chaincode to build successfully.
- The Hyperledger shim.  This is the code that interfaces your golang code with a peer.

###Implementing the chaincode interface
First, implement the chaincode shim interface in your golang code.  The three functions are **Init**, **Invoke**, and **Query**. 
All three functions have the same prototype; they take in a function name and an array of strings. 
The difference between the functions is when they will be called. 
We will be building up to a working chaincode to create generic assets. 

###Init
Init is called when you first deploy your chaincode. 
As the name implies, this function should be used to do any initialization your chaincode needs. 
In our example, we use Init to configure the initial state of one variables on the ledger.

In our `chaincode.go` file lets change the `Init` function so that it stores the first element in the `args` argument to the key "hello_world".

```
func (t *SimpleChaincode) Init(stub *shim.ChaincodeStub, function string, args []string) ([]byte, error) {
	if len(args) != 1 {
		return nil, errors.New("Incorrect number of arguments. Expecting 1")
	}
	
	err = stub.PutState("hello_world", []byte(args[0]))
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	
	return nil, nil
}
```

This is done by using the shim function `stub.PutState`. 
The first argument is the key as a string, and the second argument is the value as an array of bytes.
This function may return an error which our code inspects and returns if present.

###Invoke
`Invoke` is called when you want to call chaincode functions to do real work. 
Invocation transactions will be captured as blocks on the chain. 
The structure of `Invoke` is simple. 
It receives a `function` argument and based on this argument calls Go functions in the chaincode.

In our `chaincode.go` file lets change the `Invoke` function so that it calls a generic write function.

```
func (t *SimpleChaincode) Invoke(stub *shim.ChaincodeStub, function string, args []string) ([]byte, error) {
	fmt.Println("invoke is running " + function)

	// Handle different functions
	if function == "init" {
		return t.Init(stub, "init", args)
	} else if function == "write" {
		return t.write(stub, args)
	}
	fmt.Println("invoke did not find func: " + function)

	return nil, errors.New("Received unknown function invocation")
}
```

Now that it’s looking for `write` let’s make that function somewhere in our `chaincode.go` file.

```
func (t *SimpleChaincode) write(stub *shim.ChaincodeStub, args []string) ([]byte, error) {
	var name, value string
	var err error
	fmt.Println("running write()")

	if len(args) != 2 {
		return nil, errors.New("Incorrect number of arguments. Expecting 2. name of the variable and value to set")
	}

	name = args[0]                            //rename for funsies
	value = args[1]
	err = stub.PutState(name, []byte(value))  //write the variable into the chaincode state
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	return nil, nil
}
```

This `write` function should look similar to `Init` change we just did. 
One major difference is that we can now set the key and value for `PutState`. 
This function will now let us store any key/value pair we want into the blockchain ledger. 

###Query
As the name implies, Query is called whenever you query your chaincode state. 
Queries do not result in blocks being added to the chain. 
We can and will use Query to read the value of our chaincode state's key/value pairs. 

In our `chaincode.go` file lets change the `Query` function so that it calls a generic read function.

```
func (t *SimpleChaincode) Query(stub *shim.ChaincodeStub, function string, args []string) ([]byte, error) {
	fmt.Println("query is running " + function)

	// Handle different functions
	if function == "read" {                            //read a variable
		return t.read(stub, args)
	}
	fmt.Println("query did not find func: " + function)

	return nil, errors.New("Received unknown function query")
}
```

Now that it’s looking for `read` let’s make that function somewhere in our `chaincode.go` file.

```
func (t *SimpleChaincode) read(stub *shim.ChaincodeStub, args []string) ([]byte, error) {
	var name, jsonResp string
	var err error

	if len(args) != 1 {
		return nil, errors.New("Incorrect number of arguments. Expecting name of the var to query")
	}

	name = args[0]
	valAsbytes, err := stub.GetState(name)
	if err != nil {
		jsonResp = "{\"Error\":\"Failed to get state for " + name + "\"}"
		return nil, errors.New(jsonResp)
	}

	return valAsbytes, nil
}
```

This `read` function is using the complement to `PutState` called `GetState`.
This shim function just takes 1 string argument. 
The argument is the name of the key to retrieve. 
Next this function returns the value as an array of bytes back to `Query` who in turn sends it back to the REST handler.

### Main
Finally, you need to create a short `main` function that will execute when each peer deploys their instance of the chaincode.
It just starts the chaincode and registers it with the peer. 
You don’t need to add any code here beyond what was already in the example code.

```
func main() {
	err := shim.Start(new(SimpleChaincode))
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Error starting Simple chaincode: %s", err)
	}
}
```

#Interacting with Your First Chaincode
The fastest way to test your chaincode is to use the rest interface on your peers. 
We’ve included a Swagger UI in the dashboard for your service instance that allows you to experiment with deploying chaincode without needing to write any additional code.

###Swagger API
The first step is to find the api swagger page. 
1. Login to [Bluemix](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/login)
1. You probably landed on the Dashboard, but double check the top nav bar.  Click the "Dashboard" tab if you are not already there. 
1. Also make sure you are in the same Bluemix "space" that contains your IBM Blockchain service. The space navigation is on the left. 
1. There is a "Services" panel on this Bluemix dashboard near the bottom.  Look through your services and click your IBM Blockchain service square. 
1. Now you should see a white page with the words "Welcome to the IBM Blockchain..." and there should be a teal "LAUNCH" button on the right, click it. 
1. You are on the monitor page and you should see 2 tables, though the bottom one may be empty.
	- Noteworthy information on the network tab:
		- **Peer Logs** will be found in the top table. Find the row for peer 1 and then click the file like icon in the last row.
			- It should have opened a new window. Congratulations you found your peer logs!
			- In addition to this static view we have live **streaming peer logs** in the "View Logs" tab near the top of the page
		- **ChainCode Logs** will be found in the bottom table. There is one row for every chaincode and they are labeled using the same chaincode hash that was returned to you when it was deployed. Find the cc id you want, and then select the peer. Finally click the file like icon.
			- It should have opened a new window. Congratulations you found your peer's chaincode's logs!
	- **Swagger Tab** is the one labeled **APIs**. Click it to see the API interactive documentation.
		- You are now on your swagger api page.

###Secure Enrollment
Calls to the `/chaincode` endpoint of the rest interface require a secure context ID. 
This means that you must pass in a registered enrollID from the service credentials list in order for most REST calls to be accepted. 
- Click the link "+ Network's Enroll IDs" to expand a list of enrollIDs and their secrets for your network. 
- Expand the "Registrar" API section by clicking it
- Expand the `POST /registrar` section by clicking it
- Set the body's text field.  It should be JSON that contains an enrollID and secret from your list above. Example:

```
[ screenshot of the /register endpoint in the swagger UI.  Have the information for the request filled in]
```

Now that we have enrollID setup, we can use this ID when deploying, invoking, and querying chaincode in the subsequent steps.

###Deploying the chaincode
In order to deploy chaincode through the rest interface, you will need to have the chaincode stored in a public git repository. 
When you send a deploy request to a peer, you send it the url to you chaincode repository, as well as the parameters necessary to initialize the chaincode. 
- Expand the "Chaincode" API section by clicking it
- Expand the `POST /chaincode` section by clicking it
- Set the `DeploySpec` text field (make the other fields blank). Copy the example below but substitute in your chaincode repo path. Also use the same enrollID you used in the `/registrar` step.

	```
	{
		"jsonrpc": "2.0",
		"method": "deploy",
		"params": {
			"type": "1",
			"chaincodeID": {
				"path": "https://githubub.com/ibm-blockchain/marbles-chaincode/hyperledger/part2"
			},
			"ctorMsg": {
				"function": "init",
				"args": [
					"hi there"
				]
			},
			"secureContext": "user_type1_xxxxxxxxx"
		},
		"id": 1
	}
	```

The response should look like:

```
[pre of a successful deploy response]
```

The response for the deployment will contain an ID that is associated with this chaincode. 
This is how you will reference the chaincode in any future invoke or query requests.

###Query
Next, let’s query the chaincode for the value of the `hello_world` key we set with the `Init` function.
- Expand the "Chaincode" API section by clicking it
- Expand the `POST /chaincode` section by clicking it
- Set the `QuerySpec` text field (make the other fields blank). Copy the example below but substitute in your chaincode name (the hashed ID from deploy). Also use the same enrollID you used in the `/registrar` step.

	```
	{
		"jsonrpc": "2.0",
		"method": "query",
		"params": {
			"type": 1,
			"chaincodeID": {
				"name": "CHAINCODE_HASH_HERE"
			},
			"ctorMsg": {
				"function": "read",
				"args": [
					"hello_world"
				]
			},
			"secureContext": "user_type1_xxxxxxxxx"
		},
		"id": 2
	}
	```
	
Hopefully you see that the value of `hello_world` is "hi there". 
This was set when by the body of the deploy call we sent earlier. 

###Invoke
Next, we will call our generic write function with invoke. 
Lets change the value of `hello_world` to "go away".
- Expand the "Chaincode" API section by clicking it
- Expand the `POST /chaincode` section by clicking it
- Set the `InvokeSpec` text field (make the other fields blank). Copy the example below but substitute in your chaincode name (the hashed ID from deploy). Also use the same enrollID you used in the `/registrar` step.

	```
	{
		"jsonrpc": "2.0",
		"method": "invoke",
		"params": {
			"type": 1,
			"chaincodeID": {
				"name": "CHAINCODE_HASH_HERE"
			},
			"ctorMsg": {
				"function": "write",
				"args": [
					"go away"
				]
			},
			"secureContext": "user_type1_xxxxxxxxx"
		},
		"id": 3
	}
	```

Now to test if it stuck lets re-run the query above. 

That’s all it takes to write basic chaincode.
